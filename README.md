# Airbnb-Data-Analysis
<p>The main objective was to create an innovative and interactive Tableau dashboard to gain some insights about the Airbnb DataSet. Airbnb, Inc is an American company that operates an online marketplace for lodging, primarily homestays for vacation rentals, and tourism activities. I used a combination of line plots, map graphs and bar graphs to analyze the dataset and track the price variation with different factors. I published the dashboard on Tableau Public.
